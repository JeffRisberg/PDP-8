PDP-8 Theme, version 1.0  11/27/07

The theme for fans of vintage computers!

This theme has been designed for a screen width of 1024 or greater.  While the page width is flexible, portions will
be cut off when shown in a narrower layout.

I designed this to look like the console of a vintage DEC PDP-8 computer, with a stylized rendering of the panel
layout, and a set of animated lights.  The theme also includes images for PDP-10 and PDP-11 computers.
There are three configuration options, which allow selecting which computer image to use, selecting if the
sidebar is to the left or to the right, and selecting if the author name should be shown.

For historical information, check the Computer History Museum at http://www.computerhistory.org.  Also there is 
a photo of a PDP-8 front panel in the book "Core Memories" about vintage computers, published in 2007.  See 
http://www.corememoryproject.com/main.php for more information, including a photo of a DEC PDP-10 as well.

These computers, manufactured from the mid-60's to the early 80's, represented the high water mark of computer
packaging.  Today a computer is just a box with air vents and cables, but in this bygone era, DEC's control panels
were futuristic, more like a high tech car than just a set of functional lights and switches.

I have included the Photoshop files that created the animated gifs, so that you can modify the animation timings 
and effects.
